# Impact-Effort Matrix (Action Priority Matrix)

## Category
STRATEGIC & DECISION-MAKING

## Description
A 2x2 prioritization framework that plots options based on impact (value delivered) vs effort (resources required). Helps identify "quick wins" and avoid "time wasters" when resources are limited.

## When to Use
- Multiple competing priorities
- Limited resources (time/budget/people)
- Backlog prioritization
- Strategic planning
- Personal productivity
- Team roadmapping

## Question Sequence (4 questions)

### Question 1/4: LIST OPTIONS
What are all the potential actions, projects, or initiatives you're considering? List at least 5-10 options.

**Purpose:** Create complete option set

### Question 2/4: ESTIMATE IMPACT
For each option, what is the potential impact if done well? Rate as High, Medium, or Low impact. (Impact = value, results, strategic importance)

**Purpose:** Assess value

### Question 3/4: ESTIMATE EFFORT
For each option, how much effort (time, money, people, complexity) is required? Rate as High, Medium, or Low effort.

**Purpose:** Assess cost

### Question 4/4: PRIORITIZE BY QUADRANT
Plot each on the matrix:

**QUICK WINS** (High Impact, Low Effort) - Do these FIRST
**BIG BETS** (High Impact, High Effort) - Plan carefully, commit resources
**FILL-INS** (Low Impact, Low Effort) - Do if time permits
**TIME WASTERS** (Low Impact, High Effort) - Avoid or delegate

Which options are Quick Wins? Which are Time Wasters to eliminate?

**Purpose:** Strategic prioritization

## Expected Outcome
- Clear priority ranking
- Quick wins identified (do now)
- Time wasters eliminated
- Big bets resourced properly
- Team alignment on roadmap

## Academic Source
- Covey, S. (1989). "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"
- Eisenhower Matrix variant
- Used in: Agile/Scrum, product management, consulting

## Tips
- Be honest about effort estimates
- Consider strategic impact, not just urgency
- Review quarterly (priorities shift)
- Quick wins build momentum
- Question "high effort, low impact" items - why are they on the list?
- Combine with Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important)
