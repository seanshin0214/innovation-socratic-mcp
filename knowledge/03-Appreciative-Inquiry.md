If we built on our strengths, what could we become? What's our ideal future?

**Purpose:** Envision possibilities

### Question 3/4: DESIGN - What should be?
What structures/processes would support our ideal state? What are our "provocative propositions"?

**Purpose:** Co-construct the ideal

### Question 4/4: DESTINY - What will be?
How will we make it happen? Who will do what? How will we sustain this?

**Purpose:** Implement and sustain
